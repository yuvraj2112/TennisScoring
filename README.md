# Scoring logic for a set of tennis

This is a project that contains a logic for a game of tennis, built for a code challenge.

## Getting Started

To run the project in your own system:
* Download the git project into a folder
* Ensure you have python 3 installed in your system.
* In case it is not present, you can visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download 'Python3' for your system.
* Open a terminal window and change the directory to the recently downloaded folder.
* Run `python3 scoring.py`.

You may then follow the instructions in the console and proceed with a game of tennis.

#### There's a catch
The implemented logic has one difference from a game of tennis. Upon encountering a tie-breaker, the winner of the next game wins instead of a normal 2 game lead.

## Built With

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
